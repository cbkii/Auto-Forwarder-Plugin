## ✨ Features

* **Two Forwarding Modes:**
    * **Copy Mode:** Sends a brand new message, making it look like you sent it yourself. Perfectly preserves all text formatting.
    * **Forward Mode:** Performs a standard Telegram forward with the "Forwarded from" header.
* **Forward from Anywhere:** Create rules for any chat, including private messages, groups, and channels.
* **Advanced Content Filtering:** For each rule, you can select exactly which types of content to forward (Text, Photos, Videos, Documents, Stickers, etc.).
* **Full Formatting Preservation:** In Copy Mode, all rich text formatting is kept intact, including **bold**, *italic*, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~, ||spoilers||, and [hyperlinks](https://telegram.org).
* **Intelligent Buffering:**
    * **Album Handling:** Automatically waits to collect all photos/videos in an album before sending them together.
    * **Media Deferral:** Includes a safety net for large or slow-to-download media, ensuring files are forwarded reliably.
* **Anti-Spam Firewall:** A built-in rate-limiter prevents a single user from flooding your destination chat.
* **Highly Configurable:**
    * Set global settings for message length, timeouts, and anti-spam delays.
    * Configure each rule individually with its own filters and forwarding mode.


## ⚙️ Installation

2.  Using your device's file manager, **rename the file extension** from `.py` to `.plugin`.
3.  Send the `.plugin` file to yourself in Telegram (e.g., in your "Saved Messages").

### Editing or Deleting a Rule

1.  Go into a chat that already has an active forwarding rule.
