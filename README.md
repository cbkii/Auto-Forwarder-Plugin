## ✨ Features

* **🚀 Reliable, Ordered Forwarding:**
    * **Sequential Processing Engine:** A completely new architecture that processes messages one-by-one in a dedicated queue. This resolves race conditions and **guarantees that messages are forwarded in the exact order they are received.**
    * **Configurable Speed vs. Order:** The new `Sequential Delay (Seconds)` setting gives you direct control over the trade-off. A small delay ensures order for large batches of files, while setting it to `0` restores high-speed parallel processing (which may result in messages being forwarded out of order).

* **Effortless Destination & Topic Setup:**
    * **Set by Replying:** The easiest way to set up a rule. Simply tap "Set by Replying" in the rule dialog, then go to your destination chat and reply to *any* message with the word `set`. The plugin handles the rest.
    * **Full Topic Support:** Automatically forward messages directly into a specific topic in a group or a comment thread in a channel. The "Set by Replying" feature makes this seamless.

* **Seamless Auto-Updater:**
    * Get notified directly in the app when a new version is available on GitHub Releases.
    * View the official changelog in a pop-up dialog before updating.
    * Update with a single click—no manual downloads or installs required.

* **Two Powerful Forwarding Modes:**
    * **Copy Mode:** Sends a brand new message, making it look like you sent it yourself. This mode enables perfect formatting preservation and automatically recreated reply quotes.
    * **Header Mode (Simulated Forward):** Copies the message and prepends a custom, clickable "Forwarded from..." header, linking to the original author and chat.

* **Advanced Filtering Engine:**
    * **Keyword & Regex:** Forward messages, media captions, or **documents with filenames** that contain specific keywords or match a regular expression.
    * **Global Regex Filter:** Set a global keyword/regex pattern in the settings that can be applied to multiple rules. Each rule can optionally enable "use global regex" in addition to its local filter.
    * **Granular Content Control:** The "Text" filter is now split into "Text Messages" and "Media Captions," allowing you to forward media while stripping its caption, and vice-versa.
    * **Author Whitelisting:** Filter messages based on the author type (Users, Bots, Outgoing), or provide a specific, comma-separated list of User IDs or `@usernames` to exclusively forward messages *only* from them.

* **Intelligent & Reliable Processing:**
    * **Ordered Album Handling:** Automatically waits to collect all photos/videos in a gallery before sending them together as a single, correctly ordered album.
    * **Duplicate Notification Prevention:** A thread-safe deduplication system prevents client-side notification glitches from causing the same message to be forwarded multiple times.
    * **Anti-Spam Firewall:** A built-in rate-limiter prevents a single user from flooding your destination chat with rapid messages.
    * **Persistent Last-Seen Tracking:** Tracks the last processed message for each chat to avoid reprocessing messages.

* **Batch Processing:**
    * **Process Unread Messages:** Forward all unread messages from a chat with a single click (available in chat menu).
    * **Process Historical Messages:** Forward messages from the last X days (1-30) for any chat (available in chat menu).
    * **Global Batch Actions:** Process unread or historical messages for all configured rules at once from the settings page.

## 📖 How to Use

This plugin is configured entirely through the Telegram user interface.

### Creating a Rule (The Easy Way)
1.  Go into the chat you want to forward messages **from**.
2.  Tap the three-dots menu (**⋮**) in the top-right corner and select **Auto Forward...**.
3.  In the rule setup dialog, tap the **"Set by Replying"** button.
4.  A prompt will appear. Click **Proceed**.
5.  Navigate to your desired destination chat. This can be a user, group, channel, or even a specific **topic/comment thread**.
6.  **Reply** to any message in that destination with the exact word: `set`
7.  The plugin will instantly configure the rule and delete your `set` message. You're done!

### Creating a Rule (Manual Method)
1.  Go into the chat you want to forward messages **from**.
2.  Tap the three-dots menu (**⋮**) in the top-right corner and select **Auto Forward...**.
3.  A dialog will appear. Manually enter the destination chat's ID, @username, or private `t.me/joinchat/...` link.
4.  Configure the other options, such as content filters, keyword matching, and specific author whitelists.
5.  Tap **Set** to save the rule.

### Editing or Deleting a Rule
1.  Go into a chat that already has an active forwarding rule.
2.  Open the **Auto Forward...** menu item again.
3.  A management dialog will appear, allowing you to **Modify** or **Delete** the rule for that chat.

### Processing Unread or Historical Messages
1.  Go into a chat with an active forwarding rule.
2.  Tap the three-dots menu (**⋮**) in the top-right corner.
3.  Select **Process Unread Messages** to forward all unread messages, or **Process Messages from Date** to forward messages from the last X days.
4.  Alternatively, go to the plugin settings page and use the **"Forward Unread (All Rules)"** or **"Forward Last X Days (All Rules)"** buttons to process messages for all configured rules at once.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All global settings and a list of all active rules can be found by going to:
`Settings > exteraGram Settings > Plugins > Auto Forwarder`

Key settings include:
- **Album Buffering Timeout (ms):** How long to wait to collect all media in an album.
- **Sequential Delay (Seconds):** The pause between each message to guarantee order. Set to `0` to restore high-speed parallel mode (order not guaranteed).
- **Deduplication Window (Seconds):** Time window to ignore duplicate notifications from the client.
- **Global Keyword/Regex Filter:** An optional filter that can be applied to multiple rules. Enable "use global regex" in each rule to apply this filter in addition to the rule's local filter.

You will also find:
- **Forward Unread (All Rules):** Processes unread messages for all configured rules.
- **Forward Last X Days (All Rules):** Processes historical messages (1-30 days) for all configured rules.
- **Check for Updates:** Checks for new plugin versions on GitHub.
